# Running a server using nginx

## Making the directory

To ensure we the work we do is organized, we must first create the directory that will act as our project root.

To do so we will use the following command:

```
mkdir -p /web/html/nginx-2420
```

The _*mkdir*_ command creates a directory and _*-p*_ allows us to nest the subsequent directories within it.
